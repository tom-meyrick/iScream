## Brief

* Think up an idea for an app/website that would be     achievable in a week
* Choose one idea to pursue
* Plan out your app, how will it work (see final chapter off week 11 notes)
* Functional Spec: what does it need to do
* Wireframe (Google Drawings can work for doing this collaboratively)
* Plan out data structures (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)
* API design (URLs, HTTP methods: GET, POST, what data is needed (for non-GET requests))
* Redux actions/flow (API/state actions)
